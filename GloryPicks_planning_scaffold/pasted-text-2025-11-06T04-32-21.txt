I dont see the trading strategy being coded into the project. See below for the strategies: ICT Breaker Block & Market Maker Model Trading Strategies Introduction The Inner Circle Trader (ICT) methodology, created by Michael J. Huddleston, is a comprehensive trading approach that focuses on Smart Money Concepts (SMC) – how institutional “market makers” manipulate price through liquidity and order flow eplanetbrokers.com . Instead of relying on lagging indicators, ICT traders study price action for institutional footprints like order blocks, liquidity pools, fair value gaps, and shifts in market structure eplanetbrokers.com . Two popular ICT strategies are the Breaker Block and the Market Maker Model (Buy and Sell). This report explains how these strategies work, how to enter and exit trades with them, and important do’s and don’ts to maximize their effectiveness. Applicable Markets for ICT Strategies ICT concepts were originally applied in currencies, but they are adaptable across asset classes, including forex, stocks, indices, commodities, and even cryptocurrencies eplanetbrokers.com . In practice, the patterns can be used on any timeframe in major markets (forex, equities, futures, etc.), though Huddleston himself tends to avoid crypto trading atas.net . The key principles – identifying institutional zones and liquidity – remain the same regardless of the market. Understanding ICT Breaker Blocks Breaker Blocks are a key price pattern in ICT’s market structure theory, essentially representing invalidated order blocks that flip their role. In simple terms, a breaker block occurs when a supposed order block (a zone of institutional buying or selling) fails to hold and price breaks through it. At that point, the old order block becomes a new support/resistance zone – the “breaker block” atas.net eplanetbrokers.com . This concept is analogous to the idea of mirror levels: a former support turning into resistance after it breaks (and vice versa) atas.net . Bullish Breaker Block: Formed when a bearish order block (an area that was expected to cap price) is broken to the upside. The level that was resistance now likely acts as support. Bearish Breaker Block: Formed when a bullish order block is broken to the downside, turning an expected support zone into new resistance luxalgo.com . How to Identify and Trade a Breaker Block: A breaker block is confirmed once price decisively closes beyond the boundaries of the original order block zone, signaling that the institutional zone did not hold atas.net . At this point traders anticipate a role reversal of that zone. According to ICT principles, a price return into a breaker block is “a trade setup worth considering,” as Michael Huddleston describes – the idea is to enter on a retracement into that breaker block, in the direction of the breakout luxalgo.com . For example, if a bullish breaker block has formed (previous resistance broken upward), a trader waits for price to dip back into that zone (now support) to buy, aligning with the newfound bullish momentum. Conversely, if a bearish breaker forms (support broken downward), a retest of that zone from below is an opportunity to sell short luxalgo.com . When trading breaker blocks, it’s crucial to place stop-loss orders just beyond the breaker block zone – outside the high/low of the original order block – to protect against false breakouts luxalgo.com . Profit targets are typically set at the next logical liquidity level or market structure target. In practice, ICT traders often aim for the next pool of stop losses or an opposing order block as the take-profit zone luxalgo.com . Higher timeframe breaker blocks tend to provide more reliable signals than lower timeframe ones, so many traders confirm the setup with multi-timeframe analysis and overall trend context luxalgo.com . ICT Market Maker Models: Buy & Sell The ICT Market Maker Model is a framework outlining how large institutions (“smart money”) accumulate and distribute positions to drive major market trends blog.opofinance.com . There are two mirror versions of this model: the Market Maker Buy Model (MMBM) for bullish reversals, and the Market Maker Sell Model (MMSM) for bearish reversals blog.opofinance.com . Both models presume that markets move through phases where institutions engineer liquidity and then exploit it to fuel big moves. Below we break down each model: Market Maker Buy Model (Bullish Scenario) This model describes how a down-trending or consolidating market reverses into an uptrend through institutional action. The major phases of the MMBM can be summarized as follows blog.opofinance.com blog.opofinance.com : Original Consolidation: The market initially ranges sideways as institutions engineer liquidity on both sides – building up pending buy-side and sell-side stop orders above and below the range blog.opofinance.com . This “accumulation range” sets the stage by ensuring plenty of stop liquidity for later use. False Move & Liquidity Grab: Often, one side of the consolidation is raided to trap retail traders. In many cases, the market might spike downward to a new low (taking out sell-side liquidity) before the true rally begins. (In some descriptions this phase is called a “distribution” move – for instance, price may even push up first to a local high, luring in late buyers, and then sharply drop. The key idea is an intentional liquidity grab or false move that allows institutions to enter positions cheaply.) blog.opofinance.com Smart Money Reversal (SMR): This is the pivotal turning point where institutions reverse the trend. After running stops (e.g. a sharp down move to grab liquidity), “smart money” shifts to net long positions. The SMR often coincides with a clear market structure break on the chart – for example, price might swiftly rebound from a fake low and break a prior high, signaling a bullish reversal. Institutions use this phase to mitigate any remaining short positions and finalize accumulation of longs, often taking out final sell stops in the process blog.opofinance.com . Buy Program (Markup Phase): Now the sustained uptrend begins. Institutions drive price higher in a series of rally legs, representing net long positioning. In ICT terminology, this phase can be subdivided (e.g. Accumulation -> Re-Accumulation -> Terminus) as price makes higher highs and higher lows blog.opofinance.com . The “buy program” ultimately delivers price to a higher timeframe target (a premium price or higher liquidity pool), where the cycle may eventually conclude. During this trending phase, smart money will also generate liquidity pools below price (e.g. swing lows with stop-loss clusters) which they can later use for future operations (or for adding on pullbacks). Trading the Buy Model: A trader utilizing the MMBM will first seek confirmation that a smart money reversal is underway. This usually means spotting a market structure shift from bearish to bullish (for instance, a prior swing high gets broken after a significant sweep of lows). Once this occurs, ICT teaches using specific entry techniques to join the new uptrend blog.opofinance.com . Common entry methods include: Fair Value Gap entries: The “ICT 2022 Model” looks for a fair value gap (price imbalance) created right after the liquidity grab and structure break, and enters on a retracement into that gap blog.opofinance.com . Breaker Block + FVG: Another approach combines a breaker block (as discussed earlier) with an overlapping fair value gap to pinpoint an entry zone blog.opofinance.com . Essentially, if the SMR created a breaker block, the first retrace into that broken zone – especially if it aligns with an FVG – can be an ideal long entry. Optimal Trade Entries (OTE) or IOF Entry Drill: These involve entering on a deeper retracement (often around 62–79% Fibonacci of the reversal swing) in line with institutional order flow blog.opofinance.com . This aligns with catching a pullback during the early buy program phase, with tight stops below the SMR low. The stop-loss for buy model trades is generally placed below the Smart Money Reversal low (the final low of the liquidity grab) or below the identified breaker block/order block that signaled the turn. Profit targets are set at liquidity pools above – for example, previous swing highs, resting buy-side liquidity, or even predefined higher timeframe draw levels. This model’s goal is to ride the bulk of the ensuing uptrend by being in sync with institutional accumulation blog.opofinance.com . Market Maker Sell Model (Bearish Scenario) The sell model is the bearish mirror of the buy model, explaining how an uptrend reverses into a downtrend through smart-money tactics blog.opofinance.com . The MMSM phases are analogous but inverse blog.opofinance.com blog.opofinance.com : Original Consolidation: The market starts in a consolidation/range where institutions quietly set up liquidity traps. Pending Sell-side liquidity (SSL) is built below and Buy-side liquidity (BSL) above the range (stop orders from retail traders on both sides) blog.opofinance.com . False Move & Liquidity Trap: Typically, one more push upward occurs to draw in retail buyers. Institutions use this phase to accumulate short positions at favorable (high) prices while the market appears bullish. OpoFinance describes this phase as Accumulation because buy orders (from retail) temporarily exceed sell orders, allowing smart money to sell into that strength and build shorts “at discount” (relative to the coming drop) blog.opofinance.com blog.opofinance.com . In other words, the market maker may drive price to a peak (or make a false break to new highs) to entice buyers, then quietly position for shorts. Smart Money Reversal (SMR): Here the uptrend tops out and reverses as institutions unleash the sell-off. The SMR for a sell model is marked by a sharp break in market structure to the downside. This often involves a sudden move that violates a key support or swing low, indicating that smart money has flipped to net short. During this phase, institutions mitigate or exit any remaining longs and execute buy-side liquidity raids (i.e. stop-hunt above the highs might have just occurred and now the real move is down) blog.opofinance.com . Retail traders who bought late get trapped as the trend turns. Sell Program (Markdown Phase): Now the downtrend is sustained as price is delivered lower. Institutions drive price down in waves, reflected by net short positioning. The sell program can be seen in stages (e.g. Distribution -> Redistribution -> Terminus) as price makes lower lows and lower highs blog.opofinance.com . Throughout this phase, new liquidity pools are generated above the market (e.g. swing highs with stop orders), which the smart money can exploit later. The goal is to efficiently push price toward a lower target or higher timeframe support/liquidity zone. Trading the Sell Model: For a trader, the process is similar to the buy model but in reverse. One waits for confirmation that the bullish trend is ending and a bearish shift has begun – typically a break of market structure to the downside after a liquidity sweep up high. Once a clear market structure break (MSB) or SMR is observed, short trade entries are planned on the subsequent retracements blog.opofinance.com . Effective entry techniques may include: Shorting into a fair value gap left by the initial sell-off (after a stop raid above, price often leaves an imbalance when it reverses down; a retrace into this gap provides entry) – analogous to the 2022 FVG model but for shorts. Using breaker blocks on the short side: for example, if a bullish order block at the top failed and became a bearish breaker, one can short the retest of that new resistance atas.net . Any other ICT entry pattern (e.g. an optimal trade entry on a fib retracement of the first leg down) that aligns with the now-bearish institutional order flow. Notably, ICT suggests the same set of entry models used in the buy model can be applied here, just flipped for a downtrend blog.opofinance.com . Stop-loss placement for sell model trades goes just above the Smart Money Reversal high (the final liquidity-taking peak). Profit targets are the liquidity pools below – prior swing lows, untapped sell-side liquidity, or significant higher timeframe support zones where price might react. By following the MMSM, traders aim to catch the bulk of the new downtrend orchestrated by institutional distribution. Trade Entry and Exit Guidelines for ICT Strategies Executing ICT strategies successfully requires discipline in timing entries and exits in line with the model’s principles: Top-Down Analysis: Always start with the higher timeframe context. Identify the dominant institutional bias and key price levels on higher charts (daily/4H) before drilling down. For example, a trader might mark out a daily order block or liquidity pool, then wait on a 1H or 15m chart for a confirming break of structure to actually enter chartguys.com . Aligning trade direction with the higher timeframe institutional order flow greatly improves probabilities chartguys.com . Confirmation is Key: Avoid guessing tops or bottoms – instead, wait for clear confirmation of the setup. In practice, this means seeing evidence of the Smart Money Reversal: e.g. a market structure shift or break in the expected direction (like a higher high for a buy model or a lower low for a sell model) after a liquidity sweep. This confirmation (sometimes called a market structure shift, MSS) is the cue that institutions likely stepped in, and it significantly increases the odds of a successful trade blog.opofinance.com . Once the MSS is in place, traders then look for entry triggers (order blocks, breaker blocks, FVGs, etc.) on the pullback. Patience to let the pattern fully form before acting is crucial chartguys.com . Entries: As discussed, ICT provides specific entry tactics like entering at fair value gaps, breaker block retracements, or using the Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) zone. Whichever entry method is used, it should coincide with a liquidity pool or imbalance that price is likely to revisit. Entering on those retracements ensures a good risk-reward, as stop placement can be tight beyond the recent swing. For example, after a bullish MSS, one might enter long when price dips into the overlapping area of a breaker block and an FVG – a confluence ICT calls a high-probability “Unicorn Zone” luxalgo.com luxalgo.com . In all cases, never enter blindly; ensure multiple factors (structure break, key level, and maybe time-of-day or volume spike) align in your favor. Stop-Loss Placement: ICT strategy emphasizes protecting against stop hunts. Always place your stop where, if price reaches it, it clearly invalidates the setup. Often this means just outside an order block or beyond a liquidity level that was just taken. For a breaker block trade, the stop goes just outside the breaker zone luxalgo.com . For a market maker model trade, the stop is beyond the smart money reversal swing point (e.g., a higher low or lower high that should not be broken if the new trend is valid). Additionally, ICT recommends setting stops a bit beyond obvious swing points to account for the wicks that often probe liquidity. This way, you avoid “premature exits” from normal stop raids blog.opofinance.com . Take Profits: Exiting is as important as entering. ICT methods usually target liquidity pools for take-profit. This could be a prior major high/low, or an area of imbalance that is likely to draw price. For instance, if long on a buy model, you might take partial profits at the last relative high (where buy-side liquidity is pooled) and final profits at a higher timeframe resistance or order block. It’s recommended to align profit targets with known fair value gaps or expansion levels that the market is drawn toward blog.opofinance.com . By doing so, you capitalize on the full scope of the move. Also maintain a favorable risk-reward ratio – typically aiming for at least 1:2 or more – so that winners outweigh any losers blog.opofinance.com . Trade Management: As the trade moves in your favor, ICT traders often reduce risk (e.g. moving stop to breakeven after a significant move away from entry or after first profit target is hit). Many will also scale out profits at multiple stages – for example, take 30% off at first liquidity target, another 50% at a major target, and leave a runner for an extended move. This kind of scaling out ensures you bank profits while still allowing participation if the trend runs further. On the flip side, if the anticipated move fails to materialize (e.g. price returns back through the breaker block or back into the range), be quick to cut the trade. Discipline in following the plan (and not removing stops or holding hopes after invalidation) separates successful practitioners from the rest. Finally, consider time and volatility in planning entries/exits. ICT often points to specific high-volume trading sessions (London/New York “kill zones”) as optimal periods for the big moves eplanetbrokers.com . Entering a trade right before these sessions or around major economic news requires caution or specific strategy, as volatility can whipsaw. Ideally, align your trade entry so that momentum from institutional activity will carry it, and try to avoid holding new positions during extremely low-liquidity times or against major news releases unless you have clear justification. Dos and Don’ts for ICT Strategies Using ICT’s breaker blocks and market maker models effectively involves adhering to best practices and avoiding common pitfalls. Below is a summary of key Dos and Don’ts to keep your trading on track: Dos: Do use a top-down approach: Mark higher timeframe institutional levels and market structure first, and only then look for setups on lower timeframes chartguys.com . Ensuring your trade aligns with the broader trend or bias of “smart money” greatly improves its chances chartguys.com . Do wait for confirmation and context: Be patient and let the pattern confirm (breaker block break, market structure shift, etc.) before entering. A well-formed setup with clear evidence of institutional activity – like stop runs or volume surges at the reversal – is far more reliable than a guess chartguys.com chartguys.com . Always consider the market context (higher timeframe trend, related markets, and news events) to validate a setup. Do focus on liquidity and key levels: Identify manipulation zones where stops likely cluster (e.g. obvious highs/lows, round numbers) and watch how price behaves there chartguys.com chartguys.com . If you see price sweep a key liquidity level and then sharply reverse, that’s a hallmark of the ICT approach – use it as your signal rather than chasing random moves. Tracking these liquidity grabs and the subsequent price action will sharpen your edge. Do manage risk relentlessly: Keep your risk per trade low and consistent (often 1–2% of your capital at risk is suggested) luxalgo.com . Always place stop-loss orders at sensible locations beyond structure or liquidity so that normal noise won’t hit them blog.opofinance.com . If a trade reaches a logical invalidation point, take the small loss and move on – protecting capital is paramount. Do combine confluences for high-probability setups: Whenever possible, stack multiple signals in your favor – for example, a breaker block overlapping with a fair value gap and a Fibonacci level, all aligned with the higher timeframe bias. Such confluence zones (often called Unicorn Zones in ICT jargon) can produce very reliable trades luxalgo.com luxalgo.com . Similarly, use multi-timeframe agreement: a breaker on the 1H chart that aligns with a daily order block is more powerful than one that doesn’t. Do keep records and continually practice: Maintain a trading journal to record your ICT setups, including screenshots of charts, reasoning, and outcomes. Over time, this will help you recognize which patterns work best for you and how to refine them. It’s also wise to practice these strategies in a simulator or market replay to build skill without risking money atas.net . The more you review and drill, the more confident and precise you’ll become in live conditions. Don'ts: Don’t trade patterns in isolation: Avoid taking a trade just because you spot one element like an order block or FVG. Never ignore the broader market context. A breaker block means little if, say, the higher timeframe trend is strongly against it or if it occurs right before a major news release. Always confirm that multiple factors align; otherwise, skip the trade chartguys.com . Don’t chase obvious moves or entries: If a price move is already well underway or sitting at a very obvious technical level, resist the fear of missing out. Entering at clear, “textbook” levels without confirmation often makes you the target of stop hunts chartguys.com . For example, don’t blindly short a market just because it touches a known resistance – smart money might push it slightly beyond to trigger stops before dropping. Wait for the tell (like a false breakout and return below the level) rather than jumping in early. Don’t neglect confirmation and discipline: One of the biggest mistakes is anticipating a setup without evidence. For instance, assuming an order block will hold before price actually reacts there can lead to losses. Trade what you see, not what you think – if the chart hasn’t confirmed the reversal or if signals conflict, be willing to stay out chartguys.com . Similarly, once in a trade, stick to your plan: don’t move stops further out in hope, and don’t skip your planned profit targets due to greed. Don’t over-leverage or risk too much: ICT strategies are not immune to losses; they rely on probability and edges playing out over many trades. Using excessive leverage or outsized positions will erode your account during the inevitable losing streaks. Keep position sizing reasonable and consistent – this keeps emotions in check and preserves your capital for the long run chartguys.com . Overleveraging and failing to manage risk are common reasons traders fail, even with a sound strategy. Don’t trade during unsuitable conditions: Certain market conditions can degrade ICT setups – for example, holiday thin liquidity, unpredictable news spikes, or markets that are extremely range-bound with no clear trend. It’s usually wise to avoid trading when institutional presence is low or when price is erratic without structure. Also, skip setups that lack a clear institutional footprint (no liquidity grab, no volume surge, etc.) chartguys.com , because those may be low-probability traps. Don’t expect effortless success: Finally, avoid the mindset that these strategies are a magic bullet. While ICT concepts are powerful, they come with a learning curve. Don’t stop learning or practicing once you’ve taken a few trades. Many nuances (like reading volume profiles, time-of-day effects, refining entries) come with experience. Be prepared to continuously study charts, review ICT’s teachings, and adjust to changing market dynamics. This is a marathon, not a sprint – patience and consistency will pay off, whereas impatience and lack of preparation will hurt you. Conclusion In summary, ICT’s Breaker Block and Market Maker Model strategies offer a “smart money” lens through which to view the markets. A breaker block trade teaches us to recognize when institutional support/resistance has shifted, allowing us to trade in the direction of that shift atas.net atas.net . The market maker buy/sell models illustrate how big players orchestrate trend reversals in stages – knowing these phases helps a trader anticipate major moves rather than react to them blog.opofinance.com blog.opofinance.com . By combining these concepts, one might, for example, identify a developing buy model on a currency pair and pinpoint a bullish breaker block entry within that context, thereby joining the new trend at an optimal point. Remember that successful application comes down to execution and mindset. Using these strategies means thinking like an institution: be patient, systematic, and mercilessly disciplined. Align your trades with where the liquidity lies and where the **“inner circle” of the market is likely to strike next eplanetbrokers.com chartguys.com . With careful risk management and adherence to the do’s and don’ts above, traders can significantly improve their odds of riding the right side of the market moves. ICT’s methods do not guarantee profits (no strategy can), but they provide a powerful framework to interpret price action and make informed decisions. Treat these techniques as tools to be mastered – with practice, they can indeed become the “golden gems” that elevate your trading to a new level of consistency and success.
